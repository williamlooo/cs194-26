Hello! 

This project is split into two folders: part1 and part2

part 1: call 'python part_1.py' to run code for all of part 1

part 2: call 'python part_2.py' to run code for 2.1 (image sharpening)

part 2: call 'python hybrid_image_starter.py' to run code for 2.2 - 2.4

When run, the software will output images generated for your viewing convenience, in accordance with the project spec.
These outputs will be labeled by their corresponding section, and will be in order of progress through the project spec and website
