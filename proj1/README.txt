Hi, you can execute the software by doing the following:

1. placing all input images inside a directory called 'intake/' inside the same directory as image_combine.py
2. creating a directory called 'out_path/' in the same directory as image_combine.py, which will store all the result color images. 
3. calling image_combine.py via 'python image_combine.py'
